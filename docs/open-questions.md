# Open questions & deferred decisions

A living log of things we **noticed** but **chose not to do yet**. The
goal is that nothing important quietly disappears between iterations:
before each new step we skim this file and ask whether any item is in
scope for the work about to start.

Per-item shape:

```
### Short title
- **Status:** OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | DEFERRED | RESOLVED
- **Since:** step N (or date)
- **Context:** why this is a question
- **Notes / options:** thinking, links, paths considered
- **Resolution:** filled when closed
```

When you take an item, change its status to `IN_PROGRESS` and link the
commit / PR that resolves it. When you close it, set `RESOLVED` with a
one-line summary — keep the item in the file as a record.

## Architecture & operations

### Multi-instance support for in-memory state
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 1 (login limiter), tightened in step 3 (portal limiter, lastActiveAt tracker)
- **Context:** `LoginRateLimitFilter`, `PublicPortalRateLimitFilter` and `LastActiveTracker` all keep state in process-local `ConcurrentHashMap`s. Single-node is fine. On a second pod, users could double their rate-limit budget by being load-balanced across nodes, and `lastActiveAt` would underreport.
- **Notes / options:** Backed by Redis (Bucket4j has a Redis backend, would also serve `lastActiveAt` as a TTL key).

### Background cleanup of expired refresh tokens
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 1
- **Context:** `RefreshTokenRepository.deleteExpired` exists but nothing calls it. Table grows monotonically with revoked + expired rows.
- **Notes / options:** `@Scheduled` job, daily at quiet hour. Or piggy-back on user login. (Fix D added `email_verification_tokens`, which accumulates the same way — sweep both in one job.)

### File storage migration to S3/R2
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 3
- **Context:** `LocalStorageService` is the only `StorageService` impl. Production cloud deploys want object storage.
- **Notes / options:** Add `S3StorageService` behind `app.storage.kind` property. The interface should not change; if it does, refactor before adding the second impl.

### Audit log for sensitive actions
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 4
- **Context:** Admin can change a user's plan via `/api/admin/users/{id}/plan` — nothing records who did it. Same for hypothetical future "suspend user", "delete user".
- **Notes / options:** Separate `audit_events` table with `actor_id`, `action`, `target_id`, `payload`, `created_at`. Write via interceptor or explicit service calls.

### Admin metrics by trade after the multi-trade move
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** Fix A (2026-05-30)
- **Context:** `User.trade` (single) became `User.trades` (a value set in `user_trades`). Any future admin metric that buckets users by trade now double-counts — a GENERAL+ELECTRICAL contractor lands in two buckets, so a "distribution by trade" would sum to more than 100% of users. Nothing is broken today: `MetricsService` has no per-trade breakdown, and `AdminUserSummary` just lists each user's trades.
- **Notes / options:** When a per-trade chart is added, decide the semantics up front — count distinct users (a user with N trades adds 1 to each bucket; bucket sum exceeds the user count by design) vs. report "trade mentions" explicitly. Document the choice on the endpoint.

### Metric month boundary is UTC, not the contractor's local month
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** Fix B (2026-05-31)
- **Context:** `DashboardService` (and the admin `MetricsService`) compute "this month"/"today" as a calendar boundary in UTC. For a Kyiv-based contractor (UTC+2/+3) the dashboard's "completed this month" can differ from their local month for the first/last couple of hours of a month.
- **Notes / options:** Pick a single app timezone (e.g. `Europe/Kyiv`) for all reporting boundaries, or make it per-user once users span timezones. Low impact while single-region; revisit before launch.

### Production email delivery (Resend key + verified domain)
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** Fix D (2026-06-02)
- **Context:** Email verification ships, but real sending needs `RESEND_API_KEY` (env) and — to email anyone other than the Resend account owner — a Resend-verified sending domain in `EMAIL_FROM`. In dev the key is blank, so emails are logged & skipped: the feature works end-to-end but no mail actually goes out.
- **Notes / options:** Sign up at Resend, add `RESEND_API_KEY`; for arbitrary recipients verify a domain (DNS records) and set `EMAIL_FROM=Majstr <noreply@domain>`. Until then only the account owner's own address receives mail (Resend sandbox via `onboarding@resend.dev`). Revisit before public launch and when wiring password reset + portal notifications (same transport). **Fix E sends estimate links to client emails (arbitrary third parties) — so a verified domain is a hard requirement for that feature to work at all in production.**

## Security

### JWT secret rotation strategy
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 1
- **Context:** Today secret comes from env, no kid header, no key rollover. Rotating the secret invalidates every live access token at once. Acceptable for low traffic, painful at scale.
- **Notes / options:** Add `kid` claim, keep two keys in rotation, deprecate old after access TTL passes.

### Share-link tokens stored raw vs hashed
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 3
- **Context:** `EstimateShareLink.token` stores the raw token so the contractor can re-copy the URL later. DB compromise reveals all live share URLs.
- **Notes / options:** Hash like refresh tokens; lose the "show URL again" feature, gain breach safety. Decide once we have real users.

### Password reset flow
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 1
- **Context:** No reset endpoint — lock yourself out, lose the account.
- **Notes / options:** Needs an email service first (see below). Email transport now exists (`EmailService` / Resend, Fix D) — unblocked; just add the reset endpoint + token + email template.

### Email verification on register
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Since:** step 1
- **Context:** Anyone can register with any email; no proof of ownership. Fine for closed beta, blocks real billing later (people use throwaway emails).
- **Notes / options:** Soft model (register works immediately; banner + only share-link creation gated behind a verified email) via Resend.
- **Resolution:** Fix D — `User.emailVerified` + `EmailVerificationToken`, Resend `EmailService`, verify/resend endpoints, soft 403 `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` gate on share; existing users migrated verified (V19). Verified live end-to-end (12 checks). PWA banner/page is a separate frontend task.

### Multi-factor auth / OAuth providers
- **Status:** DEFERRED
- **Since:** step 1
- **Context:** Not needed for v1; B2C contractor audience won't expect it. Revisit if first paying customer asks.

## Business logic

### Billing integration
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 4
- **Context:** Plan change today is admin-only manual via `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/plan`. Real customers need self-serve checkout + recurring billing.
- **Notes / options:** WayForPay or Fondy for UA market; Stripe if going international. Webhook-driven plan changes flowing through the same admin endpoint internally.

### Plan downgrade with over-limit data
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 4
- **Context:** PRO user with 7 active projects downgrades to FREE (limit 2). What happens? Today: nothing — limit only enforced on CREATE. They can edit / view existing 7 projects but can't make new ones until they delete down to 2.
- **Notes / options:** Either current "soft enforcement" is fine (UX-friendly), or block writes to over-limit resources too. Pick before billing lands.

### Trial period for PRO/TEAM
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 4
- **Context:** No trial concept. New user is FREE forever until manual upgrade.
- **Notes / options:** Add `trial_ends_at` to user; `FeatureGuard` / `LimitService` reads it before checking plan.

### Team plan: actual multi-user workspaces
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 4
- **Context:** `Plan.TEAM` exists in the enum but unlocks the same per-user features as PRO plus `AI_ASSISTANT`. No notion of a workspace shared between several users.
- **Notes / options:** Workspaces would need new entities (`Workspace`, `WorkspaceMember`) and ownership semantics on existing tables would shift from `owner_id (User)` to `workspace_id`. Big change; do not start until customers ask.

### Email notifications
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Since:** step 3
- **Context:** Client signs an estimate or asks a question via portal — contractor learns about it only by refreshing the API.
- **Notes / options:** Need an email transport (Postmark, Resend, SES). Once it exists, wire it into `PublicEstimateService.sign` and `askQuestion`. Transport now exists (`EmailService` / Resend, Fix D) — unblocked; just add the notification calls + templates.
- **Resolution:** Крок 8 (web push) — instead of email, real-time browser push (VAPID / Web Push) notifies the contractor when a client signs an estimate or leaves a question. `PushService.sendToUser` is wired into `PublicEstimateService.sign` and `askQuestion`, fail-soft. An email channel for the same events remains a possible future addition, but the "contractor only learns by refreshing" gap is closed.

### Production web push (VAPID keys + iOS installed-PWA requirement)
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** Крок 8 (2026-06-04)
- **Context:** Web push ships behind VAPID keys supplied via env (`VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT`). In dev the keys may be blank — `PushService` then logs & skips, mirroring the email transport. For production a stable VAPID keypair must be generated once and kept (rotating it invalidates every existing browser subscription, forcing all clients to re-subscribe).
- **Notes / options:** Generate the keypair once (any web-push tool / the README snippet), store the private key as a secret, expose the public key via `GET /api/push/vapid-public-key`. iOS only delivers web push to a PWA **added to the Home Screen** (installed / standalone) on iOS 16.4+ — a plain Safari tab gets nothing; the frontend must detect this and hint the user to install. Also: subscriptions accumulate in `push_subscriptions`; dead ones are pruned lazily on 404/410 from the push service, but a periodic sweep could join the refresh-token / verification-token cleanup job.

## Features in the catalog enum but not implemented

### PHOTO_REPORTS
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 3
- **Context:** Enum value exists in `Feature` and grants in PRO/TEAM. No code path uses it.
- **Notes / options:** Likely a per-project gallery of contractor-uploaded photos with timestamped notes; reuses `StorageService`.

### AI_ASSISTANT
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 4
- **Context:** Only TEAM has it. No code path.
- **Notes / options:** "Draft estimate from project description" feels like the highest-value first cut. Anthropic Claude API integration; gated by `Feature.AI_ASSISTANT`.

---

## Testing & quality

### Integration tests with Testcontainers
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Since:** step 1
- **Context:** All current tests are pure-Mockito unit tests. Nothing covers Flyway migrations actually running, real Hibernate mapping, or the security filter chain end-to-end.
- **Notes / options:** Spring Boot 4 removed `@DataJpaTest` etc — see CLAUDE.md *Testing* section. Use `@SpringBootTest` + Testcontainers `PostgreSQLContainer`.

### Estimate versioning / history
- **Status:** DEFERRED
- **Since:** step 2
- **Context:** Edit a sent estimate — old version is gone. Clients may want to see what they originally signed if there's a dispute.
- **Notes / options:** Snapshot on `SIGN`, immutable thereafter. Lower priority until a customer hits it.

### Soft delete
- **Status:** DEFERRED
- **Since:** step 2
- **Context:** All deletes are hard. No "trash" / undo.
- **Notes / options:** Add `deleted_at` columns + repository scoping. Defer until someone deletes the wrong thing in anger.
